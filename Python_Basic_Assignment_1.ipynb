    "1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.\n",
    "* \n",
    "'hello'\n",
    "-87.8\n",
    "- \n",
    "/ \n",
    "+\t\n",
    "6 \n",

    "2. What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "Strings are data types with sequence of characters.\n",
    "Variables are references that you create to refer to other values in your program later.\n",
    "Eg: var = ‘abcd’\n",
    "Here var is a variable and ‘abcd’ is a string\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Describe three different data types.\n",
    "Ans: Integers, floating-point numbers, and strings.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "Ans: An expression is a construct made up of variables, operators, and method invocations, which are constructed according to the syntax of the language, that evaluates to a single value.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?\n",
    "Ans: An expression evaluates to a single value. A statement does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?\n",
    "bacon = 22\n",
    "bacon + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The bacon variable is set to 20. The bacon + 1 expression does not reassign the value in bacon (that would need an assignment statement: bacon = bacon + 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "7. What should the values of the following two terms be?\n",
    "'spam' + 'spamspam'\n",
    "'spam' * 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Both expressions evaluate to the string 'spamspamspam'\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    "Ans: Variable names cannot begin with a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?\n",
    "Ans: The int(), float(), and str() functions will evaluate to the integer, floating-point number, and string versions of the value passed to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?\n",
    "'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'\n",
    "Ans: The expression causes an error because 99 is an integer, and only strings can be concatenated to other strings with the + operator. The correct way is I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos.'.\n",
